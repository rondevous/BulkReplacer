# Telegram Translation Strings Replacer
Rename strings in your Telegram langpack in one go.

### The script is in a very early stage of development
Currently, replacer.py only works with XML files and a single find-replace pair can be used at a time.

Unicode is used, so replacements can be done regardless of which character-script you use.

## Requirements
- Python3
